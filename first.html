                <h2>Life Of Bhagat Singh </h2>
                <p>
                    <b> Bhagat Singh,</b> (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India [now in
                    Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian
                    independence movement. <br> <br>

                    Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform
                    sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest
                    British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked
                    as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist
                    theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the
                    revolution”). <br> <br>

                    In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of
                    Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a
                    silent march opposing the Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer
                    J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929
                    he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the
                    implementation of the Defence of India Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for
                    the murder of Saunders. <br> <br>

                    In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small
                    revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead
                    a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan,
                    mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James
                    Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular
                    Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was
                    injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a
                    motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As
                    he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing
                    eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police
                    head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled. <br> <br>

                    After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging
                    Lajpat Rai's death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their
                    intended target instead of James Scott. Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no
                    convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate,
                    Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two low-intensity homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the
                    Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators
                    below, shouted slogans, and allowed the authorities to arrest them. The arrest, and the resulting
                    publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh
                    gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding
                    better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in
                    September 1929.

                <h3>Portrayal of Bhagat Singh in Literature and Movies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bollywood films have been made portraying Bhagat Singh and his life. The first is
                        ‘Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh’ (1954) followed by ‘Shaheed Bhagat Singh’ (1963) starring Shammi
                        Kapoor as Bhagat Singh. </li> <br>
                    <li>After two years, Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat Singh in the film ‘Shaheed’. After that three more
                        landmark films were released in the year 2002 based on his life. The first one ‘Shaheed-E-Azam’
                        was directed by Sukumar Nair and starred Sonu Sood. </li> <br>
                    <li>The second was ‘23rd march 1931: Shaheed’ where the character of Bhagat Singh was portrayed by
                        Bobby Deol. Another film ‘The Legend of Bhagat Singh’ the character was portrayed by Ajay
                        Devgan. The 2006 film ‘Rang De Basanti’ draws parallel between the revolutionaries of Bhagat
                        Singh’s era and modern India youth. </li> <br>
                    <li>There are many songs portraying the patriotism of Bhagat Singh and his fellow revolutionaries.
                        The patriotic Hindi-Urdu songs ‘Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna’ and ‘Mera Rang De Basanti Chola’ while
                        created by Ram Prasad Bismil are largely associated with Bhagat Singh’s martyrdom and have been
                        used in a number of films portraying the character of Bhagat Singh. </li>
